# GenAI-Powered Aviation Operational Intelligence Platform

## Executive Summary

Architected and led the development of an AI-driven platform to optimize operational efficiency for a global aviation client. The system unified disparate data sources—including flight manifests, cargo waybills, maintenance logs, and weather reports—into a single intelligence hub. By leveraging Generative AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the platform automated critical support workflows, reduced manual lookup times, and provided real-time, context-aware insights to ground crews, cargo handlers, and operational staff.

## Key Responsibilities & Technical Implementation

1. Unified Data Ingestion & Orchestration

    - Designed and orchestrated Airflow DAGs to manage complex ETL/ELT pipelines, ingesting real-time flight statuses (from SITA/ARINC), passenger manifests, cargo waybills (CargoXML), and IoT sensor data from cargo pallets into Snowflake.

    - Utilized DBT within Snowflake to transform raw data into a clean, queryable "single source of truth" for analytics and AI model training, defining key metrics like load factors, connection risks, and cargo capacity.

2. AI-Powered Operational Support & RAG Pipeline

    - Built the RAG Engine: Implemented a RAG pipeline using LangChain and Python to ground LLM responses in authoritative documentation. Ingested thousands of pages of manuals (IATA regulations, aircraft maintenance manuals, hazardous materials handling procedures) into MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.

    - Contextual Query Resolution: Integrated AWS Bedrock (using Claude for complex reasoning and Titan for summarization) to power a natural language query interface. For example:

        - "What are the specific loading procedures for lithium-ion batteries on a Boeing 777F?"
        - The RAG system would fetch the exact regulatory text and steps from the vector database.

        `"Summarize the operational disruptions from the last 6 hours and list impacted cargo."` The LLM would query Snowflake for data and generate a concise summary.

    - This drastically reduced the time for ground staff and support teams to find critical information, moving from manual document searches to instant, accurate answers.

3. Microservices Architecture & Secure Deployment

    - Developed a secure, scalable backend with NodeJS (for high-throughput API services) and Python (for data-intensive AI tasks), containerized with Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes (EKS) cluster managed via Rancher.

    - Ensured production reliability by implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins (and later GitHub Actions) for automated testing, security scanning with SonarQube, and seamless deployments using ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous delivery.

    - Hardened Security: Managed secrets (API keys, DB credentials) using AWS Secrets Manager. Enforced least-privilege access with IAM roles and policies and maintained a full audit trail of API and infrastructure changes with CloudTrail.

4. Proactive Monitoring & Support Automation

    - Went beyond development to establish a premier application support foundation:

        - Created automated "runbooks" within the platform itself. For instance, an alert on "ULD (Unit Load Device) imbalance" would trigger the RAG system to automatically suggest standard re-balancing procedures from the vector store.

        - Used the platform's capabilities for Root Cause Analysis (RCA); by querying historical data in Snowflake and correlating with maintenance logs, the system could help identify recurring patterns leading to delays.

        - Monitored the health of the AI pipelines and microservices through integrated logging and metrics, ensuring high availability for operational staff.

## Impact & Value Delivered

- Reduction in Information Retrieval Time*: Ground crew and support staff resolved queries regarding procedures and regulations in seconds instead of minutes/hours.

- Improvement in Cargo Planning Accuracy: AI-generated insights into weight, balance, and connection feasibility led to more efficient load planning and reduced missed connections.

- Enhanced Operational Resilience: The scalable, containerized architecture on EKS ensured 99.9% platform availability during peak operational periods (e.g., holiday season).

- Proactive Support Culture: Shifted the support model from reactive ticket resolution to proactive intelligence and automated guidance, empowering teams with context-aware tools.
